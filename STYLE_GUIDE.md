## Form Style

### Border

Border for the forms is light gray, 2px wide, and has a slight radius. 

### Input Styling

Each label is connected to the input and the text is black on a white background.

Each input is centered with a submit button at the bottom of the form.

## Table Style

### Border 

Border for the table will be the same as the form, being a light gray 2px wide border with a small radius

### Table Headers

The table headers will be styles in a bright blue to make them stand out and show that they're are header elements. This is the same styling as on the for submit button hover event.

### Table Data Cells

The table data cells will be styled in a similar way to the table itself, with the same border. The delete row button will also have the same styling as the hover css from the form submit button.

### Table Summary

The table summary will also have the submit button hover css applied to it to make it stand out at the bottom of the page and make it look more uniform with the table headers and the rest of the table.
