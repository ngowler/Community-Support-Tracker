## Donation Tracker

The Donation Tracker component is used to track your donations made to charities. It tracks the charity you donated to, the amount, date, and any personal messages you want to include with the donation. The Donation Tracker can also be used to provide meaningful insights like total donations made over time and total amount donated, to better showcase the companies impact on the community.

## Volunteer Hours Tracker

The Volunteer Hours Tracker component is used to track volunteer activities for PiXELL River Financial employees. Employees can log the hours they've spent volunteering, the specific organizations they've volunteered at, the date they volunteered on, and their overall experience. This allows the company to track their employees volunteer efforts and also ensured employees are recognized for their contributions.

## Event Signup Tracker

The Event Signup Tracker component serves as a registration portal for PiXELL River Financial's participation in various community activities. It tracks the name of the event, the name of the person who will representing PiXELL River Financial at the event, the email of the company representative, and the company's intended role at the event. This allows the company to plan more efficiently for events and be more involved nt he community, as well as ensuring PiXELL River Financial is represented and contributes effectively to every event it signs up for.
